        <h2>Ancient Origins</h2>
        <p>The story of cookies begins in the kitchens of ancient civilizations. The earliest forms of cookies were likely made by bakers who tested the temperature of their ovens by baking small amounts of cake batter. These early cookies were simple, consisting of basic ingredients like flour, sugar, and water.
        In Persia, around the 7th century AD, sugar became more accessible, and bakers started to create sweeter versions of these early treats. The Crusades and subsequent trade routes helped spread these early recipes throughout Europe, where each region adapted them to local tastes and ingredients.</p>

        <div class="text"> <h2>The Rise Of The Modern Cookie</h2>
        <p>The 17th and 18th centuries saw cookies becoming more refined and varied. In America, cookies arrived with the early settlers and quickly became a favorite. The American tradition of baking cookies for holidays and celebrations began to take root, leading to the creation of many recipes that are now considered classics.
            The invention of baking soda in the 19th century revolutionized cookie baking, allowing for lighter and more varied textures. The chocolate chip cookie, perhaps the most iconic American cookie, was accidentally invented by Ruth Wakefield in the 1930s. She ran out of bakerâ€™s chocolate and substituted broken pieces of semi-sweet chocolate, expecting them to melt and blend into the dough. Instead, the chunks held their shape, creating the beloved cookie we know today.</p>
